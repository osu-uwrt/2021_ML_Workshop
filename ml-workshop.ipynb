    "This notebook will introduce Machine Learning. After introducing the concept, we will propose a problem to solve using machine learning concepts, implement a simple approach to solving the problem, expand the complexity of our solution while giving you the option to select the data your solution can access. We will finally explore the concept of Neural Networks, after which we will open up to quesitons."
